    "While working on a Data Science task, sometimes we have to deal with textual data. One of the problems beginners face while working on a textual dataset is counting the number of words in a piece of text. So if you want to learn how to count the number of words in a textual dataset, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through a tutorial on how to count the number of words in a column using Python."
